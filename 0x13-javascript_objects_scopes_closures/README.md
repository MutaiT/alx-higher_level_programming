# JAVASCRIPT DAY 2
Objects, Scopes and Closures in Javascript

## Task #0 Rectangle
A simple implementation of a script that creates an  empty class called 'Rectangle' that defines a rectangle.

## Task #1 Rectangle
A simple implementation of a script that creates an empty class 'Rectangle' according to the following guideines:
- The class notation must be used in  defining the class.
- The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h.
- The instance attribute width should be initialized with the value of w.
- The instance attribute height should be initialized with the value of h.

## Task #2 Rectangle
- Where the constructor takes 2 arguments w and h.
- Where we initialize the instance attribute width with the value w.
- Where we initialize the instance attribute height with the value h.
- Where we create an  emmpty object if w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer.

## Task #3 Rectangle
A class 'Rectangle' that defines a rectangle:
- Using the class notation for defining the class.
- The constructor  takes 2 arguments: w and h>.
- Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w.
- Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h.
- If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, we create an empty object.
- We create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle using the character X.
- We create an instance method called rotate() that exchanges the width and the height of the rectangle.
- We create an instance method called double() that multiples the width and the height of the rectangle by 2.

## Task #4 Square
A class 'Square' that defines a square and inherits from Rectangle of 4-rectangle.js.
- We use the class notation for defining the class and extends.
- The constructor takes 1 argument: size
- The constructor of Rectangle must be called (by using super())

## Task #5 
A class 'Square' that defines a square and inherits from Square of 5-square.js.
- Using the class notation for defining your class and extends.
- We create an instance method called charPrint(c) that prints the rectangle using the character c.
- If c is undefined, we use the character X

## Task #6 
A class Square that defines a square and inherits from Square of 5-square.js.
- Using the class notation for defining the class and extends.
- We create an instance method called charPrint(c) that prints the rectangle using the character c.
- If c is undefined, we use the character X.

## Task #7
A function that returns the number of occurrences in a list.
Prototype: exports.nbOccurences = function (list, searchElement)

## Task #8
A function that returns the reversed version of a list.
Prototype: exports.esrever = function (list)
- We are not allowed to use the built-in method reverse.

## Task #9
A function that prints the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value.
- Prototype: exports.logMe = function (item)
- Output format: <number arguments already printed>: <current argument value>

## Task #10
A function that converts a number from base 10 to another base passed as argument.
Prototype: exports.converter = function (base)
- We are not allowed to import any file.
- We are not allowed to declare any new variable (var, let, etc..).
